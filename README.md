# 📊 Full Data Analysis Pipeline: Personality & Food Preference Survey

This project explores whether personality traits (introvert, extrovert, ambivert) are associated with food flavour preferences (sweet, salty, spicy, sour, umami, bitter). More importantly, it demonstrates a **complete data analysis pipeline** — from survey creation and ethical data collection to cleaning, analysis, and final interpretation.

## 🧪 Project Goal

Investigate correlations between personality type and flavour preferences using an 11-question custom-designed survey. The research question:
> *Are different personality traits statistically associated with stronger preferences for certain food flavours?*

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This project was created for DATA 201 at the University of Calgary and walks through the **entire data analysis pipeline**:

1. **Problem Definition & Hypothesis**
2. **Survey Design & Ethics Approval**
3. **Data Collection (n = 53 participants via Qualtrics)**
4. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling (Excel/Google Sheets)**
5. **Analysis Question Formulation**
6. **Visual Data Exploration & Statistical Reasoning**
7. **Findings, Report Writing, and Presentation**

## 📈 Key Findings

- Highly sensitive individuals preferred salty, sweet, and savoury flavours.
- Introverts preferred milder flavours (sweet, savoury), while extroverts preferred bolder ones (spicy, bitter).
- Spicy food preference was surprisingly high among introverts, challenging assumptions about sensation-seeking.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Qualtrics (Survey Distribution)
